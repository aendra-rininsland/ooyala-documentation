  This is intended to be the simplest possible player one can deploy with Ooyala,
  commented as much as possible.
  
  Note that the entirety of the embedded params are included here, mostly as defaults. 
  The entire third parameter can be ommitted from HERPADERP.Player.create().

      /**
       * Basic example instantiating the player.
       * 
       * N.b., the namespace "HERPADERP" was used in the query string above. As
       * a result, the usual "OO" namespace has been replaced with "HERPADERP".
       * In other words, leave off the "namespace=HERPADERP" parameter above to
       * return Ooyala to the "OO" namespace, that is, you'd instantiate below
       * by instead calling OO.Player.create instead of HERPADERP.Player.create.
       * 
       * @param player_selector This is the ID of the element where the player should go.
       * @param embed_code A video embed code. Note this is *not* the player code above.
       * @param param_object An object containing the player's parameters. See below.
       * 
       * The following parameters are given as an object for OO.Player.create()'s 3rd option:
       * 
       * @param height Player height. Include units (px|%).
       * @param width Player width. Include units (px|%).
       * @param layout Supply "chromeless" to remove player chrome. Semi-undocumented; see: http://support.ooyala.com/developers/documentation/api/player_v3_api_modparams.html
       * @param analytics Custom analytic tags. See: http://support.ooyala.com/developers/documentation/api/analytics_custom_tags.html#analytics_tags
       * @param autoplay Boolean to control autoplaying. Does NOT work on iOS.
       * @param enableChannels Some weird old flash bullshit. Defaults to "false".
       * @param google Object to pass parameters or tags between Ooyala and Google IMA v3 ad server.
       * @param in-stream Pass In-Stream ad server or network tags to Ooyala player. No idea, TBH.
       * @param initialTime Start video at this time, in seconds (integer).
       * @param locale A locale designator to override language and closed-caption options.
       * @param loop Loop a video on continuous play.
       * @param onCreate Provide a function to be run on player creation. Highly useful, see below!
       * @param prebuffering Enable/disable prebuffering for HTML5 player (true by default).
       * @param vast Something to do with VAST ad servers, whatever those are.
       * @param flashParams For flash player programming bullshit.  Semi-undocumented; see: http://support.ooyala.com/developers/documentation/api/player_v3_api_modparams.html
       *
