# Ooyala Community Documentation
## v0.0.1

### What is this?

Ooyala is absolutely terrible at documentation. Even if able to find what
you're looking for in the badly-organised developer documentation, there's a
chance it won't work like you think it should, or mislead you into wasting a ton
of time.

Not only that, but by making the documentation static, uncommentable webpages,
Ooyala loses out on many of the benefits inherent in allowing your community
to create its own documentation.

This is an attempt to build some community documentation for Ooyala, so that 
developers -- ours and otherwise -- don't waste so much time building stuff
for Ooyala's platform.

The main component is the fully-commented module example ([/module-example][1]), 
which is will be used to generate [Doxygen API documentation][2]. There's also a
basic player example ([/simple-player-example][3]) with all the parameters
documented.

See something missing? Did I get something wrong? Comments, corrections,
pull requests and Ooyala-related flamewars are all appreciated and encouraged!

Seriously, I would **love** to accept some pull requests from people on this. 
Please contribute, it'll make it better for everyone!
