/**
 * Defines the player module.

 * @param plugin_namespace The namespace of the plugin.
 * 
 * The callback takes the following parameters:
 * 
 * @param OO The broader Ooyala library object.
 * @param _  The version of Underscore.js that comes with Ooyala.
 * @param $$ The version of jQuery that comes with Ooyala.
 * @param W  The global window object. I don't know why this is here... "window" is already global! #itisamystery
 * 
 * @note Ooyala's documentation says to supply Ooyala's jQuery as "$", however,
 * doing so will override your jQuery's "$" namespace within the plugin closure.
 * If you've added any jQuery plugins (Transit.js has been added to this project
 * as an example), the "$" object supplied by Ooyala won't be able to access any
 * of them. As such -- and given Ooyala won't give us an option to trim out any
 * unneeded libraries from the player code download -- Ooyala jQuery has been
 * supplied as "$$". This has the benefit of leaving Ooyala's dependencies in
 * place while leaving "$" mapped to the developer-supplied jQuery.
