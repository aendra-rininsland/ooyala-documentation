      /**
       * Basic instantiation of the player.
       * 
       * @param player_selector This is the ID of the element where the player should go.
       * @param embed_code A video embed code. Note this is *not* the player code above.
       * @param param_object An object containing the player's parameters. See below.
       * 
       * The following parameters are given as an object for OO.Player.create()'s 3rd option:
       * 
       * @param height Player height. Include units (px|%).
       * @param width Player width. Include units (px|%).
       * @param layout Supply "chromeless" to remove player chrome. Semi-undocumented; see: http://support.ooyala.com/developers/documentation/api/player_v3_api_modparams.html
       * @param analytics Custom analytic tags. See: http://support.ooyala.com/developers/documentation/api/analytics_custom_tags.html#analytics_tags
       * @param autoplay Boolean to control autoplaying. Does NOT work on iOS.

       * @param google Object to pass parameters or tags between Ooyala and Google IMA v3 ad server.
       * @param in-stream Pass In-Stream ad server or network tags to Ooyala player. No idea, TBH.

       * @param locale A locale designator to override language and closed-caption options.
       * @param loop Loop a video on continuous play.
       * @param onCreate Provide a function to be run on player creation. Highly useful, see below!
       * @param prebuffering Enable/disable prebuffering for HTML5 player (true by default).
       * @param vast Something to do with VAST ad servers, whatever those are.
       * @param flashParams For flash player programming bullshit.  Semi-undocumented; see: http://support.ooyala.com/developers/documentation/api/player_v3_api_modparams.html

       *  > When called, the OO.Player.create function:
       *  >    - Creates a new message bus.
       *  >    - Goes over the list of registered modules and creates all of them.
       *  >    - Connects all the registered modules to the message bus.
       *  >
       *  > When called, onCreate: function(player):
       *  >    - Checks for any additional modules (custom, 3rd party or other type).
       *  >    - Enables these additional modules to connect to the message bus.
       *  >    - Sends a message to the message bus signaling each module to start up.
       *  > ** You need to call onCreate() before anything can happen; otherwise, the
       *  > existing and additional or third-party modules are not connected to the
       *  > message bus and are not initialised.**
